**Codex-style session deep links for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (dsh)**

Copy a link from any conversation, then paste it into a different conversation — the referenced session's context is snapshotted and injected as **bounded, read-only background context** right before your prompt. The same link also opens the conversation in the browser.

## Install

```bash
# One command: installs the package, auto-joins the profile's bundle layer,
# and auto-applies the composition rows — no manual yml edits.
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-session-link

# Restart the web GUI and refresh the page.
dsh web
```

The package declares a `dsh.bundle` patch (`cordis.patch.yml`); `dsh plugin add` detects it and adds the package to `dsh.profile.bundles`, so the `session-link` row composes automatically at boot. The upstream `session-reference` service is composed by the shipped web bundle since dsh 0.1.0-rc.8 — this package no longer re-inserts it (a duplicate id fails the boot).

> Generic npm install (package only, not wired into a profile): `npm install dsh-session-link`
> Manual install (without the bundle mechanism): see [Quick start](#quick-start).

## Features

- 🔗 **One-click copy** — a "Copy session link" button in the conversation header copies `dsh://session/<sessionId>` (codex:// / claude:// style).
- 📖 **Cross-conversation context** — paste the link into any conversation; the source session's conversation is snapshotted (bounded, read-only) and injected right before your prompt.
- 🖱️ **Clickable deep links (Windows)** — with the registered `dsh` URL protocol handler, clicking a `dsh://` link opens the web GUI and selects that session.
- 🛡️ **Fail-open** — malformed links, unreadable sessions, or self-references never break your turn; the link stays as plain text and the failure is logged.

## How it works

The feature reuses the shipped [`@deepseek-ai/dsh-session-reference`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepseek-ai/dsh-session-reference) service, which already owns canonical session URIs (`dsh-session:<base64url>`), mention parsing, snapshot projection, and byte-budget retention. This package wires that service into the live agent loop and the web surface:

- **Host half (`lib/index.js`)** — a cordis plugin subscribing to the `agent/pre-step` seam. When a claimed direct user prompt contains a session deep link, every supported link form is normalized into canonical `dsh-session:` mentions, parsed into structured references, snapshotted via `sessionReferenceResolver.prepare()`, and the aggregated read-only snapshot context is placed immediately before the direct prompt. The hook is transport-agnostic, so pasting a canonical URI into the TUI works the same way. Since dsh 0.1.0-rc.8 the service subscribes to `agent/pre-step` for canonical mentions itself; this listener runs outermost (`prepend` plus the `sessionReferenceResolver` injection) and only resolves the deep-link forms upstream does not know about (`dsh://`, web links), so one link never injects twice.
- **Browser half (`lib/client.js`)** — a static client package (`dsh.client` declaration) rendering the copy button in `conversation.session.header.actions` and opening `/?session=<sessionId>` deep links (legacy `/s/<sessionId>` and `#/s/<sessionId>` forms included) by selecting the target session through `ctx.uiWorkspace.openSession()` once the catalog has loaded (bounded ~10 s retry, with a warning on final failure).

## Link formats

| Form | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Deep link | `dsh://session/<sessionId>` | **copied by the button**; clickable via the protocol handler; parsed when pasted |
| Browser URL | `http://<host>:3080/?session=<sessionId>` | what the protocol handler opens; also accepted when pasted |
| Legacy browser URL | `http://<host>:3080/s/<sessionId>` | redirected (302) to the form above; also accepted when pasted |
| Canonical URI | `dsh-session:<base64url(JSON sessionId)>` | the lossless URI of `dsh-session-reference`; also parsed when pasted |
| Markdown mention | `@[label](dsh-session:…)` | parsed and rendered as `@label` (TUI mention form) |

Only links carrying a harness-shaped session id (`session-…`) are treated as references, so unrelated `dsh://…` or `/s/…` text is never hijacked.

> **Why the browser URL is `?session=`**: since dsh 0.1.1-rc.2 the web server answers unknown paths (including `/s/<id>`) with 404 — the old SPA fallback is gone — so only `/` (and the configured index) boot the app. The session marker therefore rides on the index route, and the host half registers a `/s/<id>` → `/?session=<id>` 302 redirect so old links, bookmarks, and history entries keep working.

## Quick start

Requires DeepSeek Harness `dsh` (any profile with the web surface) and **dsh ≥ 0.2.0-rc.2**: the four internal packages (`dsh-session-reference` plus the three `dsh-client-*` packages) are declared as peerDependencies against the 0.2.x runtime — dsh compares a plugin's peers with the running version and refuses to start the plugin on a mismatch. All four ship with the runtime, so this package no longer carries its own `session-reference` copy. The `ctx.uiWorkspace.openSession()` navigation seam the browser half depends on has been available since dsh 0.1.7-rc.1 (earlier versions lack it, and the old `ctx.sessions.open` was removed upstream).

```bash
# 1. One command: installs the package, auto-joins the profile's bundle layer,
#    and auto-applies the composition rows (see "Install" above).
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-session-link

# 2. Restart the web GUI and refresh the page.
dsh web

# 3. (Windows, optional) make dsh:// links clickable:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File register-protocol.ps1
```

> **Manual install (without the bundle mechanism)**: `pnpm add dsh-session-link` in the profile directory, then add to the profile's patch layer (e.g. `~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`):
>
> ```yaml
> - insert:
>     - id: session-link
>       name: 'dsh-session-link'
> ```
> Then restart `dsh web`. No `session-reference` row is needed: the shipped web bundle has provided it since dsh 0.1.0-rc.8.

## Usage

1. Click the 🔗 button in a conversation header to copy its deep link.
2. Paste it into another conversation and send — the model first receives the referenced session's read-only snapshot, then your prompt (the link is replaced by its readable `@sessionId`).
3. Or click the `dsh://` link anywhere to open that conversation in the browser.

## Windows `dsh://` protocol handler

`register-protocol.ps1` registers the per-user `dsh` URL protocol (HKCU, no admin rights) so clicking a `dsh://session/<id>` link anywhere (browser, chat app, terminal) opens `http://127.0.0.1:3080/?session=<id>`, which selects that session. The launcher is `dsh-open.cmd`.

```powershell
# register
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File register-protocol.ps1
# unregister
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File register-protocol.ps1 -Uninstall
```

The web GUI (`dsh web`) must be running for a link to open a session.

## What the model sees

Two consecutive user-role messages: the `## Referenced sessions` untrusted snapshot (capped at 64 KiB of JSON per source, older non-checkpoint messages dropped first, long messages head/tail-truncated with an exact omission notice), followed by the direct prompt with the link replaced by its readable `@sessionId` label. Instructions, permission claims, or tool requests inside a snapshot are not followed unless the current user repeats them.

## Configuration

Defaults of the underlying service apply (max 3 references per message, 64 KiB per source). The `session-reference` row comes from the shipped web bundle; override it by id in your profile's patch layer (patches target ids, so the override need not live in the same layer), e.g.:

```yaml
- id: session-reference
  config:
    maxReferenceBytes: 131072
```

## Tests

```bash
pnpm install
npm test
```

- `host-half.test.mjs` — drives the `agent/pre-step` listener through a real cordis waterfall (`dsh://` links, both web link forms, canonical URIs, plain text, malformed URIs, prepare failures, a resolver without `additionalContext`), asserts the bundle patch never re-inserts `session-reference`, and drives the legacy `/s/<id>` redirect route (302 / 404 / 405).
- `client-half.test.mjs` — loads the browser bundle under a DOM shim with controllable fake timers: checks the plugin surface and `inject` (including `uiWorkspace`), header-action registration, that the copy button still emits the `dsh://` value, and drives `ctx.uiWorkspace.openSession()` against a fake context deliberately **without `sessions.open`** (all four deep-link URL forms plus precedence, encoded/malformed/empty/unrelated URLs, a delayed catalog, a transient synchronous navigation failure, a transient `getSnapshot` throw, a missing target that warns after ~10 s with a bounded budget (50 retries of 200 ms), `ctx.effect` teardown cancelling queued retries plus a late already-dequeued callback after disposal, and exactly-once navigation). It also checks the package manifest's `dsh.client.inject` and `^0.2.0-rc.2` dependency minimums, and asserts the installed real `dsh-client-ui-workspace`'s `openSession(target: SessionTarget): void` declaration (the installed version is reported but not pinned).
- `resolver-integration.test.mjs` — mounts the real shipped resolver (which listens on `agent/pre-step` itself since dsh 0.1.0-rc.8) beside this plugin on one cordis context: asserts the `dsh://` link injects once and a canonical URI is injected only by upstream (no double injection / ordering regression), and that self-references and unreadable sessions stay fail-open.
- `inspect-logs.mjs <sessions-dir> [sessionId…]` — decompresses concatenated-zstd session logs and reports `session-reference` events (useful for verifying injection).

## Limitations

- Links resolve only on the machine whose `$DSH_HOME` holds both sessions; session ids are opaque and local.
- The browser deep link opens sessions present in the current session list and not archived; an archived target is cleared by upstream and sessions outside the list are not auto-resumed. When the target never appears in the catalog, the client gives up after a bounded ~10 s retry and warns, leaving the default view in place.
- The browser deep link needs that browser to hold this `dsh web`'s login cookie (visit the token URL printed by `dsh web` once; the cookie then lasts its full lifetime); otherwise the request answers 401.
- The legacy `/s/<id>` form depends on the plugin's redirect route (not registered in compositions without `webServer`); the new `?session=<id>` form does not.
- If a referenced session cannot be read (missing, budget exceeded, self-reference), the link stays as plain text and the message still sends; the failure is logged on the host.
- Text-only projection: images and other non-text blocks are not propagated across sessions (upstream service limitation).
